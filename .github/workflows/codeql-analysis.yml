# IMPORTANT: This workflow conflicts with GitHub's default CodeQL setup.
# If you get the error "CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be processed when the default setup is enabled",
# you must disable the default setup in: Repository Settings → Code security and analysis → CodeQL analysis → Configure → Advanced → Disable
#
# This custom workflow provides more control over:
# - Branch targeting (runs on specific branches)
# - Scheduling (Sundays at 22:00 UTC)
# - Language selection (JavaScript only)
